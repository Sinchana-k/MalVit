# TDL-MalRob-4: Transformer-based Deep Learning for Malware and Ransomware Classification

This project implements a transformer-based deep learning model for classifying malware and ransomware based on opcode sequences extracted from static analysis. The Jupyter notebook `tdl-malrob-4.ipynb` contains the complete workflow including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Files:
- `tdl-malrob-4.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and explanations.

Description:
The notebook performs the following steps:
- Loads opcode sequence data with associated malware/ransomware labels.
- Applies TF-IDF vectorization to represent opcode patterns numerically.
- Builds a Transformer-based neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trains the model on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluates model performance using classification metrics and confusion matrices.
- Visualizes results for interpretation.

Dependencies:
To run the notebook, install the following Python packages:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn

How to Use:
1. Open `tdl-malrob-4.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.
3. Review the printed outputs and visualizations to interpret the results.

Notes:
- This implementation uses a TransformerEncoder layer to capture contextual patterns in opcode sequences.
- You may further optimize performance by tuning model hyperparameters or experimenting with additional layers and regularization.
